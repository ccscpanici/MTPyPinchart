The releases are built using pyinstaller.

On a windows machine, create a python virtualenv and install all of the dependencies (requirements.txt). If you want to use latest versions that is your preference.

Then, run the following command:
    pyinstaller main.py --onefile --icon icon.ico

The installer will build the executable into the "dist" directory.
